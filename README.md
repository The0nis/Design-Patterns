Design Patterns Exercises
1. Setup
Open IDEA IntelliJ and create a new project but this time choose Gradle as your project type and make sure that Java is selected in the additional libraries and frameworks.
Gradle is a build automation tool that simplifies all build tasks, from dependency management to the actual building, running, testing and publishing.
To use Gradle we first need to choose a GroupId (uniquely identifies your project across all projects and should follow the Java packages convention — e.g. com.yourusername.patterns), an ArtifactId (a lowercase name representing your project e.g. patterns), and a Version (1.0-SNAPSHOT is fine for now).
Make sure that “Use auto-import” is checked and click “Next”.
In the final window just select an appropriate location for the project.
